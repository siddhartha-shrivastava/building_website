My name is Siddhartha Shrivastava. I have the following qualities:

- I am constantly learning new domains, experiences and skill-sets
- I like to think mostly in graphs, distributions and analogy.

What else do you need?

### my history

My academic training is done in Electrical engineering and Data Science, with a couple of year of experience, I am super excited about real world applications.
