Firstly, thank you for your precious time.
My name is Siddhartha Shrivastava, I am a Data Science Research Associate at Columbia University, Affiliated with Dept. of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Institute.
I have completed my Master's in the middle of beautiful mountains of Colorado in Electrical engineering and Data Science.
My interest in analytics is deep, in particular I have interest in biomedical datasets & sensor's dataset.

- I am super excited in collaborative environment and collective discussion.
- I like to think mostly in graphs, distributions and analogy.

What else do you need?

### my Current Interest

Intersts are changing, so probably you should reach out to me via linkedin/email (I rarely update this page)
Currently, I am focussing on mm-wave sensors and their capability to do non-invasive testing of human body, also I am currently working on Bayesian Neural Networks for mapping 2 datasets.
